## Introduction

This project is a fully functional CRUD API for a basic blogging platform. It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete blog posts. The API is built using Node.js for the server-side logic and MongoDB as the database.

## Features

- Create new blog posts
- Retrieve all blog posts
- Retrieve a single blog post by ID
- Update a blog post by ID
- Delete a blog post by ID
- Data validation for blog post submissions
- Proper error handling for database errors and bad requests

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd blogging-platform-api
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash

- Each post includes a title, body, author, and timestamps

## Data Validation

- Implements data validation to ensure that all blog post submissions contain a title and body

## Error Handling
